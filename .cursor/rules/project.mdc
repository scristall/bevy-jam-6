Game Type: Pixel-art tower defense game (top-down), themed as the hold of a ship.
Platform: Built in Rust with Bevy 0.16 — avoid outdated engine-specific advice.
Visual Layout:

    Left edge: water + pirate spawn point (boats)

    Right edge: gold vault (defend this)

    Central area: grid-based layout where player places chain tiles to form a maze

Core Gameplay Mechanics:

    Enemies (Pirates) spawn on the left and attempt to reach gold on the right.

    Player builds a maze of chain tiles to force pirates to take longer routes.

    Pirates lose oxygen as they crawl through the maze. They die if oxygen hits 0.

    Player cannot fully block the pirates; every placement must preserve a valid path to the goal.

Technical Notes:

    A* is used for pirate pathfinding.

    Placement validation must simulate the chain being placed, then check for a valid path from entrance to goal.

    Use higher movement costs for chain tiles instead of blocking them outright (allows for more interesting pathing decisions).

    Pathfinding should support checking tile costs and dynamic updates as the maze changes.

Design Vibes:

    Inspired by Starcraft 1 / Warcraft 3 custom tower defense maps.

    Gameplay is about clever maze construction and oxygen management.

    Visuals are pixel-based, old-school and atmospheric.

What to Avoid:

    Dont generate Bevy-specific code without explicit request.

    Bevy 0.16 syntax and APIs are rapidly changing — stay engine-agnostic unless instructed. This is a game jam submission for Bevy Game Jam 6.
